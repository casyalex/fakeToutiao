1
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,698
Ichikawa!

2
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:13,783
What?

3
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,285
Don't flatfish come out at night?

4
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,622
Some swim up to shore
in daytime.

5
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,123
Big ones.

6
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,087
Try them, bro.
They're great for kimchi stew.

7
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,755
I tried it in a diner.

8
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,217
You really don't get it.

9
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,845
They don't serve the good ones
at some lousy diner.

10
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,598
You ate that fake stuff.

11
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,642
What do you mean fake?

12
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,478
I didn't mean to offend.

13
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,732
Something wrong with your bait?

14
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,317
Could be.

15
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,780
Maybe I should use your pinky.

16
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,493
Don't fuck with me!

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,829
Just kidding.

18
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,501
What the hell?

19
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,460
Sorry!

20
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,338
Someone left it in the office,
so I took it.

21
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,423
Don't bring it here, dumb-ass.

22
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,633
Sorry.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,343
Damned dangerous!

24
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,118
Bitch!

25
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,286
Bitch?

26
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,621
You slut!

27
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,123
Whore!

28
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,252
Turn around.

29
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:53,966
What are these?

30
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,720
You have money, asshole.

31
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:27,208
OUTRAGE CODA

32
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:06,956
You're next, Yoo Hee.

33
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,389
Business is slow, huh?

34
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,314
He's complaining about our girls.

35
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,108
Come over.

36
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,404
OK, in a second.

37
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,535
A Japanese yakuza is complaining.
He's asking for the boss.

38
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,787
- Yakuza?
- Yes.

39
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,332
- Where?
- Taehang Resort Hotel.

40
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,664
This way.

41
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,216
You useless bitches!

42
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,719
He'll take it out on me.

43
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,141
You alright?

44
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,811
He wanted sick stuff.
We said no, so he hit us.

45
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,980
What's the problem?

46
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,817
Your bitches are pathetic.

47
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,904
Our boss is angry.

48
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,323
He says he won't pay.

49
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,201
Where's your boss?

50
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,454
In the bedroom.

51
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,755
What's your problem
with our girls?

52
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,299
My problem? You idiot.

53
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,052
Your bitches are lame.

54
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:29,306
They need training!
They're no fun at all.

55
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,106
Looks like you had fun.

56
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,233
Don't fuck with me!

57
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,902
I'm not fucking with you!

58
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,489
I'm demanding compensation
for hurting our girls.

59
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,575
You know who I am?

60
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,537
I'm Hanada of the Hanabishi family.

61
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,040
You want trouble
with the Hanabishi?

62
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,375
Listen...

63
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,253
I even got a sworn brother in Seoul.

64
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:00,629
Asshole!

65
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,091
You're not in Seoul.
This is Jeju Island.

66
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,052
Drop the Hanabishi crap.

67
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,138
Bring it on!

68
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,147
Relax.

69
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,900
I just came to have some fun.

70
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:23,694
No need to quarrel.

71
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,488
You're the one asking for it.

72
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,991
How will you settle up, asshole?

73
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,203
I don't have cash on me right now.

74
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,082
You can come tomorrow at noon.

75
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,042
How much can you pay?

76
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,089
Two million.

77
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,716
You can't mean Korean won.

78
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,010
Not two million yen!
That's outrageous!

79
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,261
Look...

80
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,348
Think about what you did
before blurting out a sum.

81
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:57,853
I'll mince your face
and use it as bait!

82
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,523
OK, OK.

83
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,026
You'll get your Japanese yen.

84
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,700
Say...
What's your name, buddy?

85
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,702
You Japanese?

86
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,163
My name is Fuck Off.

87
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,664
Got that?

88
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,957
Pay up!

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,877
To that guy.

90
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,518
Hey.

91
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:43,106
Useless bodyguards!

92
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,900
Sorry.

93
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,655
They humiliated me.
And you two?

94
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,907
You stood there and watched!

95
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,242
Sorry, sir.

96
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,539
I'm leaving in the morning.

97
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,084
- Take care of this.
- With what money?

98
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,835
Dumbass!

99
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,755
We won't pay that bastard.

100
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,091
If he makes a fuss,

101
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,384
kill him!

102
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,553
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,932
Nakata...

104
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,727
Where's Hanada?

105
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,645
Is he late?

106
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,980
Underboss Nishino,

107
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,609
he's in Korea on urgent business.

108
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,780
He's due back
for the regular meeting.

109
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,491
Business?

110
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,163
His business
is to get his butt here!

111
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,792
I told him.
He said the offer was too good.

112
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:30,339
He left this for Chairman Nomura.

113
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,938
Don't go over my head
to gain Mr. Nomura's favors.

114
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,526
You must report first to me
on these matters.

115
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,320
My apologies.

116
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,073
That's not what we meant.

117
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,033
Forget it.

118
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,703
I'll explain it to him later.

119
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,538
I appreciate it.

120
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,083
Good afternoon, sir.

121
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,297
What's with Mr. Nomura?

122
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,176
And his constant meetings?

123
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,222
How many this month?

124
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:25,977
He was a trader.
He's uncomfortable without meetings.

125
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,814
Why should he be successor?

126
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,401
So what if he's the ex-boss' son-in-law!

127
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:39,241
He says spending is the only way
to make more money.

128
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,993
He's causing huge losses!

129
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,080
Brother, you're talking too loud.

130
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,624
I don't give a shit.

131
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,421
I won't allow what's-his-name

132
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,049
to act like he owns this place!

133
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,195
One more thing, Nakata.

134
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,284
You receive a lot of money
from Hanada every month,

135
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,453
isn't that right?

136
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,330
No, I'm not getting any.

137
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:33,378
Without your recommendation
to Mr. Nomura,

138
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:39,009
Hanada would never have
his own family.

139
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,096
Couldn't he have
appealed to him in person?

140
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,140
With money?

141
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,976
His business is thriving.

142
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,064
Loansharking to meth dealing,
he does whatever makes money.

143
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,568
He recruits biker gangs
to avoid mob busts.

144
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,489
He uses police connections
at his convenience.

145
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,158
He's quite impressive.

146
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,915
He gets the meth in Korea, right?

147
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,044
The ex-boss prohibited meth.

148
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,629
And Mr. Nomura?

149
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,006
He wouldn't interfere...

150
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,217
if the price was right!

151
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,013
Yeah.

152
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,432
Excuse me.

153
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,685
Everyone's here.

154
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:31,895
Fine.

155
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,288
Remain seated.

156
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,965
Anything happen this month?

157
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,551
Nothing unusual.

158
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:09,307
Sawamura will remain hospitalized
for another couple months.

159
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,728
We have an executive named Kono...

160
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,941
He'll be released from prison soon.

161
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,196
Fine. I expect each family
to prepare a cash gift.

162
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,533
An exec's release calls
for significant contributions.

163
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,535
Don't embarrass yourselves.

164
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,911
Yes, sir.

165
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,414
You think you're big yakuza?

166
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,250
Bragging won't boost your income.

167
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,044
Who dealt with the Security Police

168
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,131
and the government
to rebuild this family?

169
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,509
Nakata, where's Hanada?

170
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:49,097
As I told Underboss,
he's in Korea on urgent business.

171
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,433
He travelled, knowing I was here?

172
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,478
You all report to me, your Chairman,
at these regular meetings!

173
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:56,771
Yes.

174
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,652
He surely would have been here
for the former boss.

175
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,112
What do you mean?

176
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,408
I mean exactly what I said.

177
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,952
Don't fuck with me, Nishino.

178
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,874
Your lot spends money like water
and knows nothing about making it.

179
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,335
I sweat blood for this family!

180
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,295
Use your fucking brain!

181
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,888
That arrogant Nishino defies me
every chance he gets.

182
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,307
He can be a pain in the ass.

183
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,976
Any possibility to demote him?

184
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:39,272
Nishino could be replaced
by Nakata or Hanada.

185
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,151
But Nishino's loyal supporters
won't take it lying down.

186
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,654
Then we choose Nakata as a new boss.

187
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,948
Let him fight Nishino.

188
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:52,369
We'll get rid of two old farts
with one blow.

189
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,257
Brother,

190
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,010
won't you do anything?

191
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,014
He's fucking dead.

192
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,018
What will you do?

193
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,397
I'm busy thinking, dumb-ass!

194
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,212
What's that about?

195
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,339
Some Korean star?

196
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,883
Sorry. I just dyed my hair.

197
00:16:54,597 --> 00:17:00,061
There was trouble with a Japanese yakuza.
We lost a man.

198
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,773
Mr. Otomo wants to return.

199
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:07,736
Work it out amongst yourselves.
Solve it peacefully.

200
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,822
Tell Otomo to spare us any trouble.

201
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,073
Yes.

202
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,913
Our soldiers stabbed the guy
to death with an ice pick.

203
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,041
They dumped him on the beach.

204
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,544
Dumped?
What if this turns into war?

205
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,337
Yeah.

206
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,883
I don't know any yakuza in Jeju.

207
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,928
Hey, Gun.

208
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:34,929
Yes?

209
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,348
Maruyama!

210
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,101
What the hell are you doing?

211
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,396
I'm eating barbecue.

212
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,108
Are you stupid?
I told you to wait outside!

213
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,527
Sorry, sir.

214
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,118
I recruited him from a biker gang.

215
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,245
But he's a butthead.

216
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,791
For you, compliments of the house.

217
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,375
Thanks a lot as always.

218
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,420
You're welcome.
We owe you so much, sir.

219
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,924
Please drop by our bar.
It's open during the day.

220
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,553
Say, aren't you from Jeju Island?

221
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,721
Yes.

222
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,601
Who controls the hotels and casinos
in Jeju?

223
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,146
That's the turf of Chairman Chang.

224
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,816
His sworn brother Yoon is also there.

225
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,943
Chairman Chang?

226
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,153
Of Tokyo?

227
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,156
Yes. He's originally from Jeju.

228
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,616
Something happen there?

229
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,910
Nothing. You're excused.

230
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,834
Dammit.

231
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,837
You messed up.

232
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,506
You picked the wrong fight.

233
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,846
Chang is an influential figure
in both Japan and Korea.

234
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:04,435
Your argument in the hotel...

235
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,521
Was the guy named Otomo?

236
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,608
Well... I really don't know.

237
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,611
He killed that cop Kataoka.

238
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,531
Right by the funeral site, they say.

239
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,367
I think Chang gave him shelter.

240
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,538
So what do you think I should do?

241
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,293
Say one word
to cross Nomura and Nishino,

242
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,461
you'll be dead.

243
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,464
Listen.

244
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,926
I'll go to Tokyo
and visit Chang's office

245
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,720
to apologize.

246
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,638
Prepare some money.

247
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,225
How much should I prepare?

248
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,730
20 to 30 million yen,
as condolences.

249
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,732
You did kill a guy.

250
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,319
That much?

251
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,695
Idiot!

252
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,323
Chang's got shitloads of money.

253
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,534
Respond in a sincere manner,

254
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,244
he'll understand.

255
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,124
- All they lost is one lousy punk.
- Yeah.

256
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,342
The Hanabishi?
Is something going on?

257
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,469
Kind of.

258
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,140
Nakata and Hanada are talking...

259
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,684
about apologizing to Mr. Chang.

260
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,855
Really? Thanks for the tip, Gun.

261
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,108
Is Mrs. Yoon alright?

262
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,446
She passed away two days ago.

263
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,450
I sent flowers for the funeral.

264
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,244
I see...

265
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:48,790
Only those close to Mr. Yoon
were contacted.

266
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,875
I'll inform Mr. Chang.

267
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,126
Fine.

268
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,132
Mr. Lee?

269
00:20:58,883 --> 00:20:59,801
What?

270
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,471
The Hanabishi will visit us
to apologize.

271
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,974
What do we do?

272
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,435
It depends on what they offer.

273
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,484
Excuse me.

274
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,988
This is from Gun.
Interest on a debt.

275
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,490
Tell him I don't need it.

276
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,158
Guys, I'm leaving.

277
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,451
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,209
Thank you so much.

279
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,980
Mr. Chang arranged everything.

280
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,524
It's officially death by accident.

281
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,068
Money solves everything.

282
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,990
- Ichikawa...
- Yes?

283
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,661
Ko is dead. How can you fish?

284
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,664
I'm not having much fun.

285
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:17,712
I want to run to Japan,
and kill that motherfucker!

286
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,841
You think you're angry?

287
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,051
I feel the same!

288
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,226
Let's go.

289
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:33,728
Yeah.

290
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:16,813
It sucks being a chauffeur
for the head family.

291
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,606
Sure does.

292
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,275
You can't say that, dickhead!

293
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,625
Thanks for coming
all the way from Osaka.

294
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,296
We took the Shinkansen Express
to Tokyo.

295
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,882
Really?

296
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,306
So who's Hanada?

297
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,269
I'm Hanada of the Hanabishi.

298
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,272
Hanabishi... So fucking what?

299
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:04,902
Nomura or Nishino should be here,
if they had any respect for the code!

300
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,823
Deputy Underboss?
Is that a consolation prize?

301
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,703
Mr. Nomura just took over the post.

302
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,330
Mr. Nishino has screw-ups to resolve.

303
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,833
You saying this isn't a screw-up?

304
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,920
I didn't mean that at all.

305
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,091
What the hell did you mean?

306
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:32,680
A real Japanese yakuza
would chop off a finger.

307
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,017
This money's just chicken feed.

308
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,603
It won't settle everything!

309
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,105
We could go to war.

310
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,776
No need to get angry, fellows.

311
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,695
I'm sorry.

312
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,949
Did you take good care

313
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,535
of Ko's bereaved family?

314
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,622
Not yet, sorry. I'll do that now.

315
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,210
Good afternoon.

316
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,670
Sir,

317
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,506
Mr. Nakata and Mr. Hanada

318
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,674
of the Hanabishi in Osaka.

319
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,889
Our man seems to have misbehaved
on your turf.

320
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,225
We're truly sorry about it.

321
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,980
Please forgive him with this.

322
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,026
What's this for?

323
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:30,071
An apology for Ko Seong-Jin's death.

324
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,033
With this measly 30 million cash,

325
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,285
they ask for our forgiveness.

326
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,915
Bring another 30 million cash.

327
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,791
What?

328
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,292
Just get the money.

329
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,879
Those bastards have no respect.

330
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,214
Alright.

331
00:25:55,638 --> 00:26:00,059
What is he babbling in Korean?
They're disrespecting us.

332
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,354
Give them the money and split.

333
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:11,195
You're the one who told me to act
before Nomura or Nishino found out.

334
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,198
They're messing with us, stupid.

335
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:18,286
Why let them humiliate us
when we are paying 30 million?

336
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,207
5 million is really enough
for a fucking soldier.

337
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,375
You!

338
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,545
What did you say?

339
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:32,216
My precious man's life
is worth only 5 million?

340
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:41,809
Your attitude determines
if we're your poison or your antidote.

341
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,644
Get out!

342
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:50,985
All yours.

343
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,153
What?

344
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,157
Go!

345
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:12,340
I guess Chang understands Japanese.

346
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,508
That's not the damn point.

347
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,139
What do we do with the money?
It's doubled to 60 million.

348
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:26,145
Congratulatory cash gift
for the new chairman?

349
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,690
You're such a stupid ass.

350
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,361
They are pushing the Hanabishi
to fight.

351
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:40,910
Pay 100 million each to Nomura
and Nishino, and cut your finger.

352
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,750
- Really that much?
- "Really that much"?

353
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,711
How much did you earn
in the last couple years?

354
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,256
A couple billion by meth dealing
and loan-sharking alone.

355
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,385
We have no fucking choice!

356
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,808
Brother, I beg you to resolve this.

357
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,187
It won't be cheap though.

358
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,316
I got that.

359
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,498
You're saying
you went behind our backs

360
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,419
to visit Chang.

361
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,089
Sorry.

362
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,093
Chang didn't only refuse our money.

363
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,847
He gave us an additional 30 million.

364
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,599
How stupid are you?

365
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,437
His message was:

366
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:54,734
bring at least 60 million.

367
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,444
Idiots.

368
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,114
Hanada.

369
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,282
Yes, sir.

370
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,200
You didn't only lie

371
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,955
to Mr. Nomura and I...

372
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,460
You went to Korea for pleasure.

373
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:15,963
What luxury!

374
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,548
Not really.

375
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,384
I completed my work

376
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:25,639
before stopping briefly on Jeju Island.

377
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:30,728
While we were rushing around
for Mr. Nomura,

378
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:36,901
you were buying women in Jeju.

379
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,821
Now you want us to clean up

380
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,158
your shitty mess?

381
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:45,993
Sorry.

382
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:53,542
I didn't mean to cause trouble
for you, nor Mr. Nomura.

383
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,338
The trouble is you have shit for brains!

384
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,340
Moron!

385
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,512
Forget it.

386
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:10,017
I'll convince Chang and settle things.

387
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:14,522
Hanada,

388
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,024
you come with me.

389
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,943
Yes.

390
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:23,864
Mr. Nomura is a very busy man.

391
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,537
Mr. Chairman!

392
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:39,213
I'll go over to Chang's office
and settle this.

393
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,055
Hanada...

394
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,933
Come with me.

395
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,102
Underboss? May I?

396
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:58,065
You keep Mr. Nomura company.

397
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:19,879
Nishino could secretly conspire
with Chang

398
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,673
to mooch money off Hanada.

399
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,093
He wants to squeeze Hanada.

400
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,180
Chang will be convinced of that
if Mr. Nishino shows up.

401
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:34,810
But Nishino shows up
for all important occasions.

402
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,605
It's hard to see who the boss is.

403
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,772
Right?

404
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,941
For sure!

405
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,069
He works hard for Mr. Nomura
and the Hanabishi.

406
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,115
Haven't you noticed
while you're with him?

407
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,617
Are you one of them?

408
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,784
What?

409
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:54,914
He hates that Mr. Nomura
became chairman ahead of him.

410
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,751
Doesn't he want Mr. Nomura to retire
so he can take over the role?

411
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,378
He doesn't think like that.

412
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:05,466
Do you agree with Nishino?

413
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,968
You hate that I became chairman?

414
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,095
Because I was a stock trader?

415
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,599
You think the Hanabishi
haven't flourished with me?

416
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,977
I have not chosen Nishino
as my successor.

417
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,522
Your commitment to me,
to the Hanabishi...

418
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,650
that's the determining factor.

419
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:23,651
Is that clear?

420
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,445
So what do you think?

421
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,863
About what?

422
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,241
I'm asking if you are willing
to take over my role.

423
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,577
Not ahead of a brother.

424
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,329
Don't you see?

425
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,623
How much longer
can you be so loyal?

426
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:41,502
You would be his biggest obstacle
if he becomes chairman.

427
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,964
He would crush your family,
drag Hanada out,

428
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,049
and go after my assets.

429
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,676
No.

430
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,222
Listen, Nakata.

431
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,684
I want you to succeed me
as chairman of the Hanabishi.

432
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:02,106
As you say behind my back,
I'm not an up-from-the-ranks yakuza.

433
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,858
I know when to quit.

434
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,986
Think it over.

435
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,822
You guys agree?

436
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:15,035
He is very considerate
to think ahead for you.

437
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:21,291
We totally agree with him, brother.

438
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,340
Hanada,

439
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,053
prepare another 200 million.

440
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,765
100 million each

441
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,518
for Chang and myself.

442
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:47,901
I already ordered 100 million each
to be delivered

443
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,571
to Mr. Nomura and yourself.

444
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,366
Hanada, listen...

445
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,370
You can get your money back
anytime you want.

446
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,749
One day,

447
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,753
when I rule the Hanabishi family,

448
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,758
I would handpick you
to be my underboss.

449
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,595
Then everything will be mighty fine.

450
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,057
Are you sure?

451
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm sure.

452
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:26,148
Let's go to Chang's office
first thing tomorrow morning.

453
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,443
With me, it will be quick.

454
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,570
Quick as a flash.

455
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:36,784
I'll show you the finesse
that Nakata lacks.

456
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,080
- Underboss.
- What?

457
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,790
Thank you, sir.

458
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,959
I was...

459
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,461
What?

460
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,047
I was...

461
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,221
wondering if you could spare me
the finger-chopping?

462
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,849
Are you dreaming?

463
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,229
Who the fuck needs your pinky?

464
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,272
Huh?

465
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,985
Thank you so much.

466
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,572
Take good care of your pinky.

467
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,116
Yeah?

468
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,785
Your parents gave it to you.

469
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,503
They asked for money again?

470
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:34,007
We must give a cash gift to a Hanabishi
being released from prison.

471
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:37,261
We're Sanno. Why should we?

472
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,764
Because Nishino is our guardian.

473
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,642
I doubt he makes deposits
to the Hanabishi account.

474
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:47,271
Man, they should give us back
the Kimura turf.

475
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,522
It's in Tokyo.

476
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:52,359
Hey, I'm the chairman!
Don't speak as my equal.

477
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,027
Sorry, sir. I'll be careful.

478
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,195
Stupid!

479
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:59,032
Courtesy of Mr. Yoshioka
of the Kimura family.

480
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,493
Yoshioka of the Kimura?

481
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,205
That man drinking over there, sir.

482
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,584
Hey, lost yakuza!

483
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,008
Asshole. I'll crush him one clay.

484
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,217
Shit!

485
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:25,684
Are you prepared
to take over my position?

486
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,645
Move fast if you are ready.

487
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,897
Huh?

488
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,691
What should I do?

489
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,485
Do something about Nishino.

490
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:39,031
Kill the Underboss?

491
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:44,203
He went with Hanada
to apologize to Chang.

492
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,247
It should be easy
to make it look like a conflict.

493
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,751
Strike him at night when he returns.

494
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,837
Everyone will accuse Chang.

495
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,300
You see, Nakata?

496
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:03,055
There are hurdles to overcome
if you want to be a leader.

497
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,932
Your do-or-die moment.

498
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,602
But Hanada must live
because we can use him.

499
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:14,942
While you're at it,
eliminate Chang too.

500
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,819
They will only get in our way.

501
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:22,199
Whoever wins, it will look like
a Nishino vs. Chang conflict.

502
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,243
Use your brain.

503
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,457
Look at their stupid faces!

504
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,336
What the hell are we doing here?

505
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,047
We don't belong to the Hanabishi.

506
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,801
They practically treat us
like their servants.

507
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,472
Anyway, it appears
Otomo had a part in this.

508
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,895
I hope the Hanabishi-Chang fight
won't end in a truce.

509
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,984
Then we can restore the Sanno
to equal them as in the past.

510
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,069
You're right.

511
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,155
Otomo.

512
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,659
I think he's still in Jeju.

513
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,995
Should I contact him?

514
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:14,626
This is Mr. Wang's proposal
on the Hong Kong project.

515
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,586
Fine.

516
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,965
Should I continue, Mr. Chairman?

517
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,842
Fine.

518
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:23,468
Mr. Chang!

519
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,137
Please look at this.

520
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:30,517
This asshole caused you
a serious inconvenience.

521
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,354
I'm sorry about that.

522
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,481
Is this the Hong Kong figure?

523
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,816
Yes.

524
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,861
We're aware of your reputation.

525
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,531
It spread to the Kansai region, too.

526
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,493
So...

527
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,956
on behalf of the Chairman
of the Hanabishi...

528
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:59,713
I, Underboss Nishino,
come to greet you in person today.

529
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,466
Not so different from Korean hotels.

530
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,136
Yes, and what about Taiwan?

531
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,138
Will you forgive him?

532
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,725
We are proceeding acquisitions
with this developer.

533
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
As a sign of our apology...

534
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,316
I brought 100 million cash.

535
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,279
Say we won't sell
for less than 8 billion.

536
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,864
Yes, I'll inform them.

537
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,914
That's English.

538
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,253
Thank you for traveling.

539
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,506
We'll accept 30 million.

540
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,926
It's only the amount you had arranged.

541
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,429
You've made a friendly gesture.
We're not yakuza.

542
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,223
I must ask you to leave.

543
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,859
Aren't we dining out in Kyoto?

544
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,904
Where the hell is he taking me?

545
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:10,867
Aren't there many restaurants
near the station?

546
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,869
How far are we going?

547
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:17,290
Mr. Nakata told me to follow his car.

548
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,209
I don't know where.

549
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:25,882
Mr. Nakata and I ate once
in a <i>ryotei</i> restaurant on this road.

550
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,806
It's the best season for sweetfish.

551
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,978
Freshwater fish tastes too fishy for me.

552
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,480
I'd rather have sushi.

553
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,949
Why stop at a place like this?

554
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,337
I'm sorry.

555
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:09,259
We took the wrong path.
We'll turn around here.

556
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,052
Hurry up, moron!

557
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,728
What the fuck!

558
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,360
- Hanada.
- Yes?

559
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,321
Whose side are you on?

560
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:32,824
What's going on?

561
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,659
Who is he?

562
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,204
Really?

563
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,706
You still don't understand?

564
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,208
Listen.

565
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,503
Chairman Nomura.

566
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,671
That motherfucker

567
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,217
tried to instigate Nakata.

568
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,886
He tried to rub me out.

569
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,139
And take you down with me.

570
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:57,557
No way!

571
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,393
You know how much I did for him?

572
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,687
You know that, don't you?

573
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:06,942
Stop squirming.
You're not getting out.

574
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,156
Whose side are you on?

575
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,910
Answer before you get out.

576
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:20,497
How could I possibly take his side

577
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,415
in this situation?

578
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,584
Please let me get out the car!

579
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,879
Fine, go.

580
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:34,427
Tell them someone attacked us both
near Chang's office.

581
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:38,390
Only you got out alive.

582
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,935
Tell that to Nomura.

583
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,688
Yes.

584
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,315
Go ahead and move the car.

585
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:10,422
Fine.
Dump him in the lake, too.

586
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:11,631
Yes, sir.

587
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,883
- What?
- Let's go.

588
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,304
What are you doing?

589
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:18,138
Underboss!

590
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,056
Don't forget: you're the only survivor!

591
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,993
Why are you dressed like that?

592
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,371
I'm sorry.

593
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,250
I came directly from the site.

594
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,545
I borrowed these from one of my men.

595
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,007
What happened to Nishino?

596
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:01,181
One of my men was shot to death.

597
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,354
I almost drowned in the lake
with Mr. Nishino.

598
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:14,110
I managed to escape from the car
on my own.

599
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,782
I don't know what happened to Nishino.

600
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,996
He must be dead.

601
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,456
Right?

602
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,094
Motherfucker Chang!

603
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,888
What do we do about Chang?

604
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,057
That's the problem.

605
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,770
No backing down quietly
after Nishino's death.

606
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,397
Up to it, Hanada?

607
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,234
Who?

608
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,154
Me?

609
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,533
Get some guys together.

610
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,077
You can do it.

611
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,249
Yes.

612
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,587
What are you doing about Chang?

613
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,258
I got a man tailing him.

614
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:22,429
He frequents his favorite coffee shop.

615
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,597
Your refill.

616
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,899
<i>Nishino was attacked after
the meeting with Mr. Chang.</i>

617
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,277
<i>Hanada's men are on the way.</i>

618
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,738
<i>Please tell him to watch out.</i>

619
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:41,281
Did you call Choi?

620
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,367
<i>He was unreachable,
so I called you.</i>

621
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,869
Got it.

622
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:47,620
Get the car ready.

623
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,465
Armed?

624
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:02,719
Put it back, stupid.

625
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,055
Let's recap.

626
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:10,143
We shoot the bodyguards first.
Alright?

627
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,144
Yeah.

628
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,645
We can do this.

629
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,647
Let's move!

630
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:55,063
Are you alright, Mr. Chang?

631
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,732
I'll take care of this.
Please go on ahead.

632
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,876
They screwed up.
Let's go.

633
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:17,836
Yeah.

634
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,964
Those punks were never going to succeed.

635
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,467
A screw-up?

636
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,847
It's pointless to kill his henchmen
and let Chang live!

637
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,391
Hanada only works with cheap punks.

638
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,977
You counted on him to do the job.

639
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,021
"The Kimura family is working on it."
Now what?

640
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,691
It's time to get your shit together!

641
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:41,818
Yes.

642
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,280
Things are going from bad to worse.

643
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,408
They don't know we're behind this?

644
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,451
Not the dead ones.

645
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,121
They didn't drink to sworn brotherhood.

646
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,415
It's my ass if they find out!

647
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,877
You want to be underboss?

648
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,796
Pull it together and resolve this!

649
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,381
Yes.

650
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,772
Mr. Chang says he's alright.

651
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,358
<i>How could he be alright?</i>

652
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:26,070
<i>They went after him
and killed your henchmen.</i>

653
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,615
If you see it that way.

654
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,701
<i>We should let them do whatever?</i>

655
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,579
<i>Who the hell is behind this?</i>

656
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:39,125
They blame us
for the attack on Nishino.

657
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:43,129
It might be someone
inside the Hanabishi.

658
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,391
Brother, can I go with you?

659
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,810
Listen.

660
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,480
I'm not your boss

661
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,899
nor your brother.

662
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,443
You're asking the wrong person.

663
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,656
If I ask Mr. Lee,
he'll say no.

664
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,866
He already told me no.

665
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:13,826
What now?

666
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,622
What would you do?

667
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,167
Go after the Hanabishi.

668
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:23,920
You'll die.

669
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,005
So be it.

670
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:49,320
Chang is the fixer and mastermind
of Korean politics and industry.

671
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,866
We have yet to identify
the punks who attacked him.

672
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,537
We only know they are connected
to the Hanabishi.

673
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,288
Osaka Police is on it.

674
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:03,459
It's either vengeance against Hanada

675
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:07,672
or retaliation for Nishino,
but he's still missing.

676
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,968
Korean fixer vs. Hanabishi.

677
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,513
First we go to Chang.

678
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,348
You'd better watch out.

679
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:22,103
He's influential. One wrong move
could lead to a diplomatic issue.

680
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,065
I went there once with Mr. Kataoka,

681
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,902
when we tailed Otomo
after his release from prison.

682
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,466
We're from the Metropolitan Police.
We have some questions for you.

683
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,893
Is he telling us to walk?

684
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:09,067
Pompous ass!

685
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,582
Something happen with the Hanabishi?

686
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,877
I already told another officer:

687
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,129
we know nothing.

688
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:35,885
So no clue why you were attacked
in the coffee house?

689
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:43,059
I worked on some cases
during the Sanno-Hanabishi conflict.

690
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,689
There was a yakuza named Otomo
who was associated with you.

691
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,944
I think he settled in Jeju
after the conflict.

692
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:54,779
What's his connection to this?

693
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,615
He paid a visit to the Hanabishi.

694
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,159
He was eventually banished.

695
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,622
Would you admit it's somehow
related to this case, Mr. Chang?

696
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,294
These days,
Japanese police have no manners.

697
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,671
Sorry.

698
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,007
Mr. Chang is busy.
I must ask you to leave.

699
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,845
Come on, let's go.

700
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,653
Leave it.
They'll start killing each other.

701
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,490
But we can't leave empty-handed
without a clue.

702
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:45,139
Isn't that Otomo?

703
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,766
It's him.

704
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,976
What's he up to?

705
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,605
Let's detain him.

706
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,243
How did you get your passport?

707
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,996
Gun arranged it for me.

708
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,707
Mr. Lee.

709
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,625
Yes?

710
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,212
Please keep it secret from Mr. Chang.

711
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,049
About Gun too.

712
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,592
Yes.

713
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,097
<i>Pull over your vehicle.</i>

714
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:30,142
<i>Plate number S300A5573.
Silver Mercedes.</i>

715
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:34,146
They're tailing me already.

716
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,931
I know you just landed,
but take a ride to the station with us.

717
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,773
Move over.

718
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,554
Mr. Chairman!

719
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,223
Assholes!

720
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,309
It's not bulletproof!

721
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:55,644
I could have been shot!

722
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,397
Clean up this mess now!

723
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,231
Yes, sir!

724
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,649
Move it!

725
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:05,821
Don't use that dialect.
I hate the Kansai accent!

726
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,907
You move it!

727
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,533
Out of my way!

728
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,416
Which family is he from?

729
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,043
Anybody know?

730
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:24,757
Excuse me.

731
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,842
Nakata! Hanada!

732
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,472
Oh, you must be Kono.

733
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,265
Honored to finally meet you.

734
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,102
Get out of prison today?

735
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:39,855
Sorry I can't be as hospitable to you
as the former boss.

736
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:40,940
Bear with me.

737
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,900
I don't mind at all.

738
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,652
You're looking well.

739
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:48,531
Although, I was almost killed
a few minutes ago!

740
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,620
Mobilize all your men
and the Kimura family in Tokyo.

741
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,622
Destroy Chang now.

742
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:59,041
I'm already on their hit list.

743
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,876
Hold on a second.

744
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,547
It was Hanada who caused this conflict.

745
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,466
We made it look like Nishino vs. Chang.

746
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,969
And I told you it was a pretext

747
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:14,390
for you to mastermind perfectly,
then I'd make you my successor.

748
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:16,225
Now I'm on their hit list.

749
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,104
To both the police and Chang,
you're obviously behind this.

750
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,899
Fix this
or we'll be ridiculed by everyone.

751
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,159
<i>SANNO ENTERPRISES</i>

752
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,581
- Is Mr. Shiroyama here?
- He's inside.

753
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:44,962
Excuse me.

754
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,924
Not now.

755
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,093
Yes, sir.

756
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:59,059
This is really a conflict between
the Hanabishi and Chang.

757
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,519
Idiot!

758
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:05,816
They murdered brother Nishino,
who was your guardian.

759
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,362
You should be first in line
to attack Chang.

760
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:15,367
Cut your bullshit
or I'll destroy the Sanno.

761
00:58:17,453 --> 00:58:19,538
What's so funny?

762
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,624
Nakata!

763
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,919
Shut your mouth.

764
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,671
At least try!

765
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:28,714
What?

766
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,509
You're just a deputy
acting like our guardian.

767
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:35,137
Or you think
you already took over the family?

768
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,180
Huh?

769
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,935
What's with you?

770
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:44,146
The minute Mr. Nishino was gone,

771
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:48,400
you had a complete change of attitude.

772
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:50,694
Stupid ass.

773
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:53,906
Out of my way!

774
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,034
Don't just stand there!

775
00:58:58,077 --> 00:58:59,787
Coming in!

776
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,253
It's not nice to bully the weak.

777
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,049
What are you looking at?

778
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:16,720
Don't look at me
like I'm a fucking ghost.

779
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,514
Shitheads.

780
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,268
The Hanabishi is in danger
of disintegration.

781
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:28,023
We must work together amicably
when necessary.

782
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,527
No one ever taught you that?

783
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,279
You punks!

784
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,787
Mr. Chang warns that
detaining Otomo longer

785
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,957
might put the police into
an overwhelming situation.

786
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,460
I wasn't aware of this inconvenience.

787
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,796
I will settle it quietly.

788
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,632
I advise that.

789
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,267
I've had enough of this.
It's been two days.

790
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:07,479
Boss Kato of the Sanno betrayed you.
Kimura got his family.

791
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,482
Kataoka used you
to break up the Sanno.

792
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,901
You got rid of three of them!

793
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,029
Fuck if I know!

794
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:16,655
I'll make sure you never talk again.

795
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,324
Do it, motherfucker!

796
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,994
You two are total dumbasses.

797
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,664
Didn't Kataoka tell you anything?

798
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,009
What?

799
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,470
What is it?

800
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:42,431
The higher-ups said not to dig deeper.

801
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,851
Chang probably pressured
to release Otomo.

802
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:50,272
You can go.

803
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,486
Thanks so much.

804
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:03,160
After all that bossing around,
now what?

805
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,663
An order from your boss
and it's over.

806
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:07,414
I'm free to go!

807
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,375
Punk!

808
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,341
He's a material witness.

809
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:20,886
How can you let him go?
That intimidating bastard!

810
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,347
We should detain him
for another 10 or 20 days!

811
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:28,018
Whatever Chang says,
why must the police obey him so easily?

812
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,395
- Relax.
- Bullshit!

813
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,896
The police are the dirtiest!

814
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,648
Look who's talking!

815
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,192
- Calm down!
- Shut up!

816
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,368
Everything alright?

817
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,538
Your car is here.

818
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,874
Mr. Chang told you to pick me up?

819
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,000
Yes.

820
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,585
Mr. Lee,

821
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:56,255
I have to go somewhere.

822
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,382
Can you drive back alone?

823
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,801
Are you up to something?

824
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,971
You asked Ichikawa and others
to join you.

825
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,265
I did no such thing.

826
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:10,602
Mr. Chang doesn't want any more trouble.

827
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,940
Kindly take Ichikawa back to Korea.

828
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,651
Mr. Chang's request.

829
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:24,283
Please tell him I went back to Jeju.

830
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:27,661
I will cause him no trouble.

831
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,644
- It had to be a remote place.
- Yeah.

832
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,146
They have eyes on me.

833
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,649
This is Gun.

834
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:00,819
He arranged passports and everything.

835
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:03,405
Sorry about the random passport names.

836
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,657
I'm fine with Goro Yamada.

837
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:08,327
I loaded the firearms in the back.

838
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,497
Take your pick, although some are old.

839
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,249
So, what now?

840
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:17,836
First thing...

841
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,507
we take down the Hanabishi in Tokyo.

842
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:38,941
Boss, are we safe drinking
in this kind of place?

843
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:43,529
Can you excuse us?

844
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,364
Come on, girls.

845
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,540
What do you mean by that?

846
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,751
What's wrong with drinking on my turf?

847
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,713
Right?

848
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,174
My thoughts exactly.

849
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,094
The Kansai guys chose
to quarrel with Chang.

850
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,680
We in Tokyo should get along.

851
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:11,056
True!

852
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,350
About the attack on Hanada...

853
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:17,062
No one suspects our involvement yet,
so stop worrying.

854
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,750
I arranged Yoshioka to meet us
and told you where he is.

855
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,673
Don't think it's over,
simply because you paid.

856
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,026
Where's Yamazaki?

857
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,987
He's upstairs.
Can I help?

858
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,280
Police.

859
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,546
Boss?

860
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,465
What?

861
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,800
The police are here.

862
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:31,803
Leave us.

863
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,431
OK.

864
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,941
Detective,
I rather you not show up here.

865
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,692
I'm square now.

866
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,319
Bear with me.

867
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:50,489
I have some questions
about the late Kimura.

868
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:56,036
You were an aide of Kato,
the former Sanno chairman.

869
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,958
Are you implying I'm a suspect?

870
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,169
Give me a break.

871
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:10,509
Didn't Kataoka give you guns
and tell you to make a raid on Kimura?

872
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:17,349
I don't give a damn
if a yakuza like Kimura was killed.

873
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:20,352
Besides,

874
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:25,399
you haven't arrested the perp
that killed Kato.

875
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,027
Damned if I know where he's at.

876
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,784
Shigeta speaking.

877
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:39,496
Nightclub shootout?

878
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,540
Is it Otomo?

879
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,626
Canvassing the area.

880
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,962
I'm heading back.

881
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:48,964
Detective?

882
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,466
Is Otomo back in Japan?

883
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,511
Mind your own business.
We'll talk later.

884
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:02,269
The 2nd Division is short-handed.

885
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,563
Really?

886
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:08,316
Tell him to lay low for a while.

887
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:14,906
All contact with Chang
must go through me from now on.

888
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,700
Yes, sir.

889
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:32,257
What did he say?
To stay away from Chang?

890
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,717
Something like that.

891
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,261
It doesn't matter.
Let's arrest Otomo on this.

892
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,345
We should, Shigeta.

893
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:41,683
For now, you're transferred
to the 2nd Division.

894
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,605
Why am I off the case?

895
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,024
The order came from above.

896
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:55,113
Letting Otomo kill Yoshioka was perfect.

897
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,157
Surveillance cameras off.

898
01:07:57,282 --> 01:08:00,577
We are now officially victims
who happened to be there.

899
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:05,207
They will eventually conclude
Otomo did it.

900
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:07,876
I think so, but...

901
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:11,254
what happens to the Kimura family?

902
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,966
I wish the Hanabishi would withdraw
and return the turf.

903
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:17,803
That wouldn't be in our favor.

904
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:21,348
Besides, is the timing right
for us to get it back?

905
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:24,059
They will suspect us.
Think harder!

906
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,061
It's the Hanabishi.

907
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,981
Hello. Has something happened?

908
01:08:31,358 --> 01:08:34,778
He's always sucking up
to the Hanabishi!

909
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,156
Take action like Otomo!

910
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:40,826
Stupid asshole!

911
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:47,582
I was wondering if we could discuss
what to do with Otomo.

912
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,835
I see.

913
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,963
Give me a call
if you find anything.

914
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,006
Yeah.

915
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,856
It seems Otomo did it.

916
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,159
I'll call Chang.

917
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:35,046
A phone call from Mr. Nakata
of the Hanabishi.

918
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:36,548
Nakata?

919
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,888
Tell him the secretary is unavailable
to take messages.

920
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,723
Yes, understood.

921
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,643
His secretary is unavailable.

922
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,813
Please call back later.

923
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,775
That bastard Nakata.

924
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:59,196
He only made calls and complained.

925
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:01,740
A useless prick!

926
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:05,202
Who the hell is this Otomo anyway?

927
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:09,748
He's just a punk.
Get rid of him.

928
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:13,585
I've arranged that.

929
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,546
Take care of business.
Incompetent!

930
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,672
Yes.

931
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:31,019
Mr. Yoon sent us.

932
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,520
Thanks so much.

933
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,189
We are ready and at your service.

934
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:36,983
And Mr. Otomo?

935
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,026
In the car.

936
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,403
Good evening.

937
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,030
Get in.

938
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:45,700
Ask him how Mrs. Yoon is doing.

939
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,952
Yes.

940
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:50,080
How is Mrs. Yoon?

941
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,123
She's fine.

942
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:55,418
She sends her regards to Mr. Otomo.

943
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,295
He said she's fine.

944
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:58,713
She sends her regards.

945
01:10:58,838 --> 01:10:59,714
Kill them, Ichikawa!

946
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,151
I shot my own man.

947
01:11:22,988 --> 01:11:25,031
Where did they come from?

948
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,908
Sorry.

949
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:30,287
He said Mr. Yoon sent them to help us.

950
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,916
It must be the Hanabishi.

951
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:42,173
They even prepared these.

952
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,764
Only two of us left.

953
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,248
You got some mean weapons!

954
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,250
No surprise.

955
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,836
Got attacked?

956
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,588
So I've heard.

957
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,674
Put down your weapons.

958
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,718
We're unarmed.

959
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,517
Let's have a chat.

960
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,603
You ordered them to do it?

961
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,439
Why would we do that?

962
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,650
Hey, Otomo!

963
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:28,822
It was that bastard Nomura.

964
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,451
Long time no see.

965
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,912
I thought you were dead.

966
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,331
No more than you.

967
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,793
Nomura almost got me killed.

968
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,921
But some of us don't die easily.

969
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,384
It all started

970
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:53,221
with Hanada's stupid actions.

971
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,516
Show some fucking respect!

972
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,234
I didn't realize you were Mr. Otomo.

973
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,321
I apologize for my behavior in Jeju.

974
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:12,532
Please forgive me.

975
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:19,247
Things would have been different
if you had told me who you were.

976
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:27,839
Your boss and I reached an agreement
concerning Hanada.

977
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:35,472
But Nomura put his nose
in other people's business again.

978
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:39,309
There's nothing left to do.

979
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,811
He must retire!

980
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:46,858
Your boss prefers that.
Doesn't he?

981
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:52,530
Can you put all that behind us?

982
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,201
Maybe give us a helping hand?

983
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:03,541
We're throwing a welcome home party
for an executive named Kono.

984
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,921
That bastard Nomura will be there.

985
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,050
I want you...

986
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,553
to dispose of him.

987
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:19,307
I will give you

988
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:23,895
the Kimura family
if you can pull it off.

989
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:26,773
I don't want it.

990
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,912
So you won't go?

991
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:23,997
No.

992
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:26,583
The party's for him,

993
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,961
but his soldier did the killing.

994
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:32,463
He served five years.

995
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,968
Why should I give him
exorbitant gift money?

996
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,971
I promoted him to executive.

997
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:43,141
Fine. I'll inform them.

998
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,483
<i>Welcome Home, Mr. Naoki Kono</i>

999
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,485
Way to go, Kono!

1000
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,131
- What's going on?
- Mr. Nomura is not coming.

1001
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,299
No?

1002
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,346
Typical of that greedy bastard!

1003
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,849
All the better.

1004
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:30,271
In his absence,
I'll announce a thing or two

1005
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,524
and show off some guns.

1006
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,777
Everyone will jump to my side.

1007
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:37,028
Yes.

1008
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:42,200
By the way, Otomo will have my back.
Send him a message.

1009
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,079
Tell him we call off the plan
to shoot Nomura.

1010
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:50,333
He wasn't there
the last time I checked.

1011
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,085
What?

1012
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,170
He's useless.

1013
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:59,717
Thank you for such a great party.

1014
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:04,847
I am greatly humbled
to be in the presence

1015
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,309
of so many of my superiors.

1016
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,896
The honor is more than I deserve.

1017
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,861
Chairman Nomura, Underboss Nishino,

1018
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,864
and ranking deputy underbosses,

1019
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,742
I shall honor your confidence in me.

1020
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:28,329
I am dedicated
to Hanabishi prosperity...

1021
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,083
Underboss!

1022
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:33,876
Kono.

1023
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:36,254
Sorry to crash your party.

1024
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,800
Listen up.

1025
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,724
A few days ago,

1026
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,937
I, Underboss Nishino,

1027
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,274
was nearly killed

1028
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,610
by Chairman Nomura.

1029
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,576
If Nakata had not told me beforehand,

1030
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,954
I would have been wiped from existence.

1031
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:11,789
See?

1032
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,586
You should know,

1033
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:22,133
you who work your asses off
to serve the family...

1034
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,762
Nomura doesn't care shit about you.

1035
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:30,057
All this to now say,

1036
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:35,396
I must sever my loyal ties to him.

1037
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,485
I ask you this:

1038
01:19:43,029 --> 01:19:44,822
side with Nomura

1039
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,617
or side with me.

1040
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,162
Choose now.

1041
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:53,623
Good evening.

1042
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,666
Sign in, please.

1043
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,277
Otomo!

1044
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:25,530
Who told you to shoot?

1045
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:32,620
Mad motherfucker!
You're out of your fucking mind.

1046
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,414
Mad motherfucker!

1047
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:55,685
Are you sure Nomura is at home?

1048
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,230
Yes. I had them check.

1049
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,820
That fiend Otomo

1050
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:08,906
shot everything that moved.

1051
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:12,243
He might have killed every Hanabishi.

1052
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:20,251
I would have crushed Otomo
in any other situation.

1053
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,254
Forget it.

1054
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,382
That fucker Nomura,

1055
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,510
Otomo can have him!

1056
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:45,276
He killed all of them?

1057
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,571
Nakata, you're banished.

1058
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:53,326
What would happen to us
if all our guys got killed?

1059
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:55,828
I'll tell you.

1060
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:00,458
It was your plan.

1061
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:03,294
You're banished.

1062
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,463
Is that you?

1063
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:08,090
Nishino, you're still alive!

1064
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,552
Still? That's not nice.

1065
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:18,893
You were plotting with Nakata
to rub me out.

1066
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:26,317
Nice guy Mr. Nakata
kindly informed me of everything.

1067
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:28,861
That's no way to speak
to your sworn father.

1068
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,363
Screw your father-son bullshit!

1069
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:31,614
Nakata!

1070
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,951
How dare you betray your boss?

1071
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,746
Who's more important?
Sworn father or brother?

1072
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,083
Nomura...

1073
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:48,881
We never ever thought of you

1074
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,343
as a yakuza nor a father.

1075
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:57,431
You don't have tattoos.

1076
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:00,309
You've never been to prison.

1077
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:05,356
You're a fucking amateur!

1078
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:10,695
A fucking amateur who calls himself
chairman of the Hanabishi.

1079
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,034
You can't fool us!

1080
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,829
Morishima, do something about him.

1081
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,455
Why should I care?

1082
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:27,378
You're just a retired office worker
without your henchmen.

1083
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:28,879
You too?

1084
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,506
You're betraying me?

1085
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:33,342
Betray is too strong a word.

1086
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:38,222
It gives the impression
that I was on your side.

1087
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:42,059
Forgive me, Chairman.

1088
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,817
You'll all regret this.

1089
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:51,068
Hey,

1090
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:53,654
Nomura.

1091
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:57,033
If you're a real yakuza,

1092
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,870
then pumping you with bullets
is your end.

1093
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:06,751
I can show you how gruesome
yakuza really are.

1094
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,466
- Take him out.
- Yes!

1095
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:18,220
What are you doing?

1096
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,264
Take your hands off me!

1097
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,266
I'm your Chairman!

1098
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,287
Get out!

1099
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,124
Stop it!

1100
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,626
Who are you?

1101
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,461
Here he is.

1102
01:24:50,878 --> 01:24:53,464
Just as I promised.

1103
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:57,426
Otomo, what are you doing?

1104
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,763
I'm Chairman of the Hanabishi.

1105
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:03,808
You don't have what it takes.

1106
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:08,104
I'm going to take you

1107
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,773
on a little excavation.

1108
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:22,159
Anybody out there?

1109
01:25:27,206 --> 01:25:29,583
Help!
A man's stuck down here!

1110
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:31,877
Help!

1111
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:37,800
Oh, shit!

1112
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:40,136
No, no. I'm here.

1113
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:43,430
I'm stuck down here.

1114
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,231
That was fucking close!

1115
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:58,195
You could have killed me.

1116
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,206
No...

1117
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,834
Down here!

1118
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:18,382
Down here!

1119
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,893
We have settled with the Hanabishi.

1120
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,356
How do we avenge Ko's death?

1121
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:37,234
I have some ideas.

1122
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:39,153
Good.

1123
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,887
There have been some complications.

1124
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,806
Mr. Nomura has passed on.

1125
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:11,393
We, survivors,

1126
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:18,400
must work hard to restore the family.

1127
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,780
As of today,

1128
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:27,534
the Hanabishi
is under new administration.

1129
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:36,043
I am appointing myself
as your new Chairman.

1130
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,798
Nakata is your underboss.

1131
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:46,262
Hanada is a deputy underboss.

1132
01:27:48,389 --> 01:27:55,771
I expect the new administration
to commit to achieving prosperity.

1133
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:56,814
Yes, sir!

1134
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:57,940
Fine.

1135
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:05,864
Sir.

1136
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,326
One moment.

1137
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:10,995
Thanks.

1138
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:14,498
Yes. What is it?

1139
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,419
Really? How was it?

1140
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:21,130
Too much!

1141
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,632
My answer?

1142
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:25,509
Of course, yes!

1143
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,304
Bye.

1144
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,472
- Hanada.
- Yes?

1145
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:34,184
Why are you so wired?
Going out for women again?

1146
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:36,186
Sort of.

1147
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:42,776
Mr. Nishino and Mr. Nakata
arranged some girls for my celebration.

1148
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,779
You don't even have proper henchmen.

1149
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:48,782
They only treat you nicely
because you pay a lot.

1150
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:51,952
Want to come along, brother?

1151
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,580
I don't approve of your perversions.

1152
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:06,884
Obeying bureaucracy is the only way
to get ahead on the police force.

1153
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:10,929
Shigeta, don't be so cynical.

1154
01:29:12,389 --> 01:29:14,475
Give me an update.

1155
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,311
I was thrown off an open case.

1156
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:23,567
Nomura plotted to kill Nishino
and to promote Nakata in his place.

1157
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:28,405
Nishino and Nakata corresponded secretly
to deceive Nomura.

1158
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:31,742
The official story blames
another family.

1159
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,244
No one knows the real truth.

1160
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,164
Really?

1161
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,336
Congratulations on your promotion.

1162
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,422
No need for sarcasm.

1163
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:49,009
Don't bother. It's my treat.

1164
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,763
<i>Letter of Resignation</i>

1165
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,304
Mr. Nishino informed me.

1166
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,557
The entrance is that way.

1167
01:30:37,558 --> 01:30:38,600
Fine.

1168
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,437
But you're coming.

1169
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,082
Sit down.

1170
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,842
What are you doing here?

1171
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,183
Good look!

1172
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,768
You two can go.

1173
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:28,317
Your mouth will see fireworks.

1174
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,374
Otomo!

1175
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,540
What do you want to talk about?

1176
01:32:24,665 --> 01:32:27,084
I heard Hanada was attacked.

1177
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,086
It may not be safe here.

1178
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,420
Right.

1179
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:32,464
Not safe at all.

1180
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,446
Hello?

1181
01:32:56,572 --> 01:32:59,783
Otomo made a raid on our office.

1182
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:05,038
Give us a moment alone.

1183
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:07,291
Excuse me.

1184
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:19,261
Otomo was unexpectedly cooperative
about our requests.

1185
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,973
I didn't expect him to eliminate Hanada.

1186
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:25,017
But of course.

1187
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:30,314
After all, Hanada was the source
of the problem.

1188
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:36,403
Otomo is quite meticulous
when it comes to sense of duty.

1189
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:41,283
As long as we don't touch Chang,

1190
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,660
he'll do what we ask.

1191
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,664
Thanks to him,

1192
01:33:48,165 --> 01:33:52,669
we got control
of Hanada's turf and revenue.

1193
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:55,839
Your methods are increasingly
more intricate.

1194
01:33:56,757 --> 01:34:01,678
My blood froze when he went haywire
at the party.

1195
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:06,433
What do you plan to do about Otomo?

1196
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:09,895
Otomo!

1197
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:16,276
He wreaked havoc on the Hanabishi.

1198
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:23,200
That old-fashioned gangster
definitely served us well.

1199
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:26,578
We go for him to the bitter end.

1200
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:30,832
What will you do?

1201
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:38,590
That guy Lee who works for Chang
said he would take on the task.

1202
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:43,345
We are annoyed at Hanada's murder.

1203
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:48,725
We want them to settle the score.

1204
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:52,896
That's what we tell Lee.

1205
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:13,083
Nishino called to inform me

1206
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,086
Hanada has been killed.

1207
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:23,385
I explained we had no part in it.

1208
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,519
Tell Otomo

1209
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:37,065
if he did it for me,
then he's done enough.

1210
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:47,367
Thank you.

1211
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,458
Let me know if you come to Jeju.

1212
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:56,293
I'll take you around.

1213
01:35:57,878 --> 01:35:59,796
We'll try that kimchi stew.

1214
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,800
When will you be back?

1215
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:07,471
I still have something to do.

1216
01:36:10,724 --> 01:36:12,309
Don't be too reckless.

1217
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,731
I should get going.

1218
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:33,121
We have no intention of making trouble
for the Japanese police.

1219
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,333
Thank you.

1220
01:36:39,336 --> 01:36:41,338
Did Otomo leave?

1221
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:44,716
Yes. Ichikawa called a minute ago.

1222
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,802
Tell him...

1223
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:51,681
I want Otomo to call me.

1224
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,683
Yes, I'll do that.

1225
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:20,585
This auto shop?

1226
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:24,130
The two guys who killed Kimura
work here.

1227
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:28,927
You should leave after this last job.

1228
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:01,543
Otomo!

1229
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:24,900
So, this is it.

1230
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:44,961
Mr. Otomo,

1231
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:47,130
forgive me.

1232
01:38:48,882 --> 01:38:52,969
I can't allow you to make anymore trouble
for Mr. Chang.

1233
01:38:55,472 --> 01:39:00,143
No need, Mr. Lee.

1234
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:03,146
I can take care of myself.

1235
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:14,783
My regards to Mr. Chang.

1236
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,485
Mr. Otomo is dead.

1237
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:54,447
He is?

1238
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:03,373
He told me
to give you his regards.

1239
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:42,871
Somethings pulling.

1240
01:40:42,996 --> 01:40:44,080
Did I catch one?

1241
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:47,125
Got it, brother! We'll have that kimchi stew.

1242
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,169
Look at that, brother.

1243
01:44:11,246 --> 01:44:14,916
